Question 1
What will be the output of the following JavaScript?

const a = true;
if(!a) {
    console.log("Green");
} else {
    console.log("Blue");
}



Green


Blue

Correct
That's correct! The NOT operator results in the condition being false. Therefore, the code inside the else statement will execute and Blue will be output.

2.
Question 2
What will be the output of the following JavaScript?

var x = true;
x = 23;
console.log(x);



true


23

Correct
That's correct! The x variable is re-assigned the value 23. Therefore, 23 is output by the code.

3.
Question 3
What is the data type of the x variable in the following code?


var x = 0 != 1;



Number


BigInt


String


Boolean

Correct
That's correct! 0 != 1 will result in a true value which is a boolean.

4.
Question 4
What will the following JavaScript code output?

var x = 10;

if(x > 10) {
    console.log("Apple");
} else if(x > 5) {
    console.log("Pear");
} else {
    console.log("Orange");
}



Apple


Pear


Orange

Correct
That's correct. The x variable is equal to 10 so the first condition fails but the second condition succeeds. Therefore, the code inside the else if statement executes and Pear is output.

5.
Question 5
What will the following JavaScript code output?

var result = 0;

var i = 0;
var limit = 3;
while(i < limit) {
    result += 2;
    i++;
}

console.log(result);



0


2


3


6

Correct
That's correct! The loop will run 3 times and each time add 2 to the result variable. Therefore, 6 will be output.

function addTwo(a,b) {
    return a + b
}
addTwo(5,"10")

Question 12
What does this code do?

function addFive(val) {
  return val + 5;

It defines the addFive function and exports it as a Node module so that it can be used in other files.


This syntax is invalid.


It allows you to invoke the addFive function without the parentheses.

Correct
Well done. It's a way to export the addFive function as a module that can be used elsewhere.
